CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmlpack.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "mlpack", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mlpack" with any
  of the following names:

    mlpackConfig.cmake
    mlpack-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mlpack" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "mlpack_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "mlpack"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
